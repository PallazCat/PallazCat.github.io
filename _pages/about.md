Who I Am
======
I am currently a junior student majoring in mathematics in Peking Universty.

My Email
======
zhaoyapeng@stu.pku.edu.cn

My Purpose
======
Out of curiosity about making websitesI make this to introduce myself and I will put some handnotes about courses I have studied to record my experience in studying mathematics and some other interesting things.
 
I am currently studying abstract algebra mostly using the book written by Dummit and Foote, and real analysis using a book written by stein and a book written by Zhou Minqiang, which is the greatest Chinese textbook I have ever read. I plan to read all of them and try my best to solve every exercise in them.
