I studied in the college of Chemistry and Molecular Engineering in the first and second year at PKU. However, due to my severe interest in Mathematics, I changed my major into Mathematics at my third year of my college life. So I am now a student in the school of mathematical science.

My Purpose
======
Out of curiosity about making websitesI make this to introduce myself and I will put some handnotes about courses I have studied to record my experience in studying mathematics and some other interesting things.
 
I am currently studying abstract algebra mostly using the book written by Dummit and Foote, and real analysis using a book written by stein and a book written by Zhou Minqiang, which is the greatest Chinese textbook I have ever read. I plan to read all of them and try my best to solve every exercises in them.
