Who I Am
======
I am about to graduate and be a PhD studnent at the University of Toronto majoring in Pure Maths. 

I think I am outgoing! Anyone who has the same interests is welcome to email me and make friends with me!

My Academic Interests (Anyone who has the same interests is welcome to email me and make friends with me!)
======
Generally, I am interested in Mathematical Physics, but I do have broad interests in both mathematics and sciences.

Hilbert’s sixth problem was partially solved by Andrey Kolmogorov in the 1930s by putting
probability theory on an axiomatic basis. The most recent advance is the derivation of fluid equations
via Boltzmann’s kinetic theory in 2025. However, there are infinite open problems left, including
deriving those equations by more reliable and realistic models, establishing a rigorous mathematical
foundation for AI, and solving the original version of Hilbert’s 6th problem–axiomatizing theories of
physics. I truly hope I can make progress in this area.
 
My Hobbies
======
I love sports and I am absolutely an outdoorsy people.

I am an amateur runner, interested in 5k, 10k, half marathons and full marathons. I could finish a marathon in 3h15min, but I was injured at the end of 2025. I am trying to recover!

I love trail running as well, I enjoy running across rivers in the mountains, watching beautiful sightseeings at the same time! I hope that one day I can climb snow-covered mountains.

Research Projects
======
I finished a project lying in the interface of Maths and Chemistry under the supervision of Zhiqiang Li from Peking University, it has been submitted.(ie Yan†, Maolin Wang†, Junzhong Xie†, Yapeng Zhao†, Xianghui Shi†, Yuxiong Hu, Shixiang Yu, Xingwu Liu, Chaowu Xue, Shuheng Tian, Yaxuan Wang, Zijun Peng, Wu Zhou, Hiroyuki Asakura, Meng Wang, Zhiqiang Li*, Zhu-Jun Wang*, Ding Ma*, Reactive Oxygen Pool over Ceria Enables Catalytic Oscillation. Submitted. (†: First authors; *: communication authors.))

I am currently working on multiple research projects. I am doing a project related to Lee-Yang zeros under the supervision of Roland Roeder from IU Indiapolis, collaborating with a PhD student there. Besides, I am conducting my senior thesis related to Dyson Hierarchical Model. Furthermore My research projects and my reading under
the supervision of professor Ilia Binder from the University of Toronto can be viewed as one initial step of my interest in Hilbert's 6th problem.

I hope I can understand the relationship between those areas one day.
