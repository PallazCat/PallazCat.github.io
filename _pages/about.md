Who I Am
======
I am From Sichuan.

I am currently a junior majoring in Mathematics at Peking University. I’m passionate about running.

Originally, I majored in Chemistry when I first started university, but after two years of study, I switched my major out of curiosity.

I’ve participated in a marathon and completed a half-marathon. Now, I’m preparing to take part in my first full marathon.

In addition to my studies, I’m learning French and have developed an interest in French musical theatre, particularly Mozart: L'Opéra Rock.
